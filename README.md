# Package Versions

Versions of Python and R packages are listed in each Jupyter Notebook files and R Markdown files.
I have not tested the codes for any other versions that are not listed in the files, so there could be an issue when using other versions. Note that the Jupyter Notebooks might have different versions for the same package because I was running several virtual environments...

# Selenium (for `Scraping.ipynb` and `quick_analysis_1001.ipynb`)
You would need to install Chrome and [download the ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) that matches your OS and Chrome version for Selenium to work properly.

# Slides
